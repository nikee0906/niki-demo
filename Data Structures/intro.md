 ### Primitive DTypes --
 
   There is no need to declare data type explicitly in python. For example:
   ```python
   x=10
   ```
   This first creates an **integer object** in memory and THEN assigns the 10 to the identifier(x). Hence x is treated as an object rather than a simple variable or a pointer.
   1. INTEGER
      ```python
      x=10
      ```
   2. FLOAT
      ```python
      x=5.25
      ```
   3. COMPLEX Numbers
      ```python
      x=10+2j            #here a, b are real numbers; j is imaginary part of the real number
      print(x.real)
      print(x.imag)
      ```
   4. STRINGS
       ```python
      str = '''hello'''
      ```
   5. BOOLEAN
      ```python
      x=True
      y=False
      ```
   6. NONE
      ```python
      x=None            #None type declares vars w/o any initial value; is not equivalent to 0 or empty str value
      ```
